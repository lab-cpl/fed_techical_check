# Bateria

Para revisar la bateria se debe tener:

1. La planilla de *ciclos de carga de la bateria*
2. El script *fed_batt_test.ino*
3. El script *fed_batt_analysis.R*



## Testing battery capacity

### Battery is below expected capacity

### Battery is at or above expected capacity


# Motor

## Testing RPM or motor turns per seconds

### Motor turns slower than expected

### Motor turns at proper speed

## Checking M1 and M2 connectivity

### Multimeter outputs no signal

### Multimeter signals correct connectivity

## Checking Feather M0 to motor shield power relay


# Infrared sensor

## Checking sensor detection area

### Sensor detection area is less than expected (or nonexistent)

### Sensor detection area is as expected

## Checking sensor digital signal

### There is no digital signal present

See [Checking signal wire](#Checkingsignalwire)

### Digital signal output is as expected

## Checking sensor resistance

### Resistance is damaged or resistance lectures are not expected

# Checking signal wire {#Checkingsignalwire}

## Signal wire is unsoldered or damaged

## Signal wire is properly connected, resolder or replaced


# 3D parts integrity

## Comparing 3D parts against original STL file

### Parts are damaged or not similar to STL file

### Parts are as expected
